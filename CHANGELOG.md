## [0.8.10] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Lifecycle registration version mismatch** - Service lifecycle metadata is now injected during config load so `service.name` is always `economy` and `service.version` always matches the installed package version (instead of drifting to `1.0.0` defaults)

### Changed

- **Config example cleanup** - `config.example.yaml` no longer asks users to set service name/version manually; lifecycle toggles remain configurable
- **Retention realism** - Removed inactive-user nudge example from `config.example.yaml` (no reliable contact path for absent/offline users)
- **Bounties docs sync** - Restored `bounties` section in `config.example.yaml` with schema defaults

[0.8.10]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.8.10

## [0.8.9] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Chat message handler crash** - Removed invalid `event.uid` access from `handle_chatmsg` in `kryten_economy/main.py`; `ChatMessageEvent` does not define `uid`, which could raise `AttributeError` and skip chat-trigger processing for that message

[0.8.9]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.8.9

## [0.8.7] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **User guide** — New end-user documentation at `docs/user-guide.md` with PM command quick start, queue/search flow, event window behavior, and troubleshooting notes; written to render cleanly on GitHub and Reddit

### Changed

- **Admin guide refresh** — Updated `docs/admin-guide.md` to reflect 0.8.6/0.8.7 behavior, including `status`/`eventstatus`, queue/search event lockout semantics, now-playing queue credit announcement, and corrected ad-hoc event command syntax
- **Repo hygiene** — Added `uv.lock` to `.gitignore` and documented the user guide in README

[0.8.7]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.8.7

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Silent heist join failure** — When a user says "join" in chat but lacks funds (or hits another error), the bot now PMs them an in-character explanation instead of failing silently
- **Heist announcement missing buy-in** — The crew-forming announcement now shows the wager amount so users know the cost before joining

[0.7.4]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.7.4

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Heist Narrator** — `HeistNarrator` and `heist_narratives` modules with 160+ built-in narrative templates; supports static, LLM, and hybrid generation modes
- **Metrics Collector** — Centralised `MetricsCollector` replacing per-attribute counters; SQLite-backed counter persistence (replaces NATS KV)
- **Chat heist join** — Users can now type "join" in chat to join an active heist (in addition to PMs); debug logging added to `handle_chat_heist_join`
- **Grafana dashboard** — JSON dashboard definition for economy metrics
- **Releasing guide** — `docs/releasing.md` with release workflow documentation
- **Start script** — `start-economy.ps1` convenience launcher for Windows

### Changed

- **Config hardening** — `config.yaml` removed from version control and added to `.gitignore` (contains secrets)
- **Scheduler / presence / database** — Various robustness improvements and metrics integration

### Fixed

- **Heist join unreachable on production** — Chat-based heist join hook in `handle_chatmsg` was never committed; production heists timed out because nobody could join via chat

[0.7.3]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.7.3

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **Missing dependency** — `croniter` added to `[project.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`; was required at runtime but omitted from the package manifest

[0.7.2]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.7.2

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **`about` command** — New `system.about` NATS command and `about` PM command; reports current version (from package metadata — single source of truth) and formatted uptime (`Xh Ym Zs`)

[0.7.1]: https://github.com/grobertson/kryten-economy/releases/tag/v0.7.1

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-12
